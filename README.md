# IFish 🐟

A personal blog dedicated to my hobby - fishing.
The blog consists of two functional components: the client panel and the admin panel. 
The client panel allows you to view posts. The admin panel is protected by authorization. 
Administrators can add, edit, and delete posts. The data is stored in the database of the 
Firebase service.

## Quick Start

<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/Elzier/IFish.git</code></pre>
`cd IFish`\
`npm install`

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
